## A flocking model using boids

This program implements a variation of Craig Reynolds' Boids model for
simulating flocks of birds. It is highly customisable via the command line. It
includes several different models.

The program can be compiled simply by running `make` in its root directory.

It can then be run using `./boids`. This will use all its default values (as shown below).
